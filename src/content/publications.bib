  abstract={Minimal-invasive surgery provides patients with benefits such as fewer incisions, faster healing times, reduced postoperative pain and bleeding, minimized scarring, and shorter hospital stays. To enhance its effectiveness ultrasound imaging or magnetic resonance-based guidance systems have been developed. However, research in robotics, sensors, and medical imaging is quickly evolving often presenting new solutions to the still persisting artifact and real-time feedback issues. To test those navigation technologies specialized phantoms are needed. Currently, existing phantoms are offering small tissue-like materials variability and are made of materials not suitable for extensive testing of minimally invasive surgery technologies. In this paper, we present a preliminary study about dedicated phantom design and manufacturing process, and data collection with special attention to vibroacoustic signals for future analysis.Clinical relevance: Widely available phantoms not only serve an important part in new technology testing in an invivo environment but also allow medical doctors to practice their skills in safe conditions.},

  abstract={In many clinical procedures, precise needle localization is crucial for avoiding organ damage and ensuring accurate target placement. Most imaging systems come with some limitations and produce artifacts in combination with the devices that hinder accurate needle localization, particularly with respect to visualizing the tip of the needle. We propose to use vibroacoustic signals generated during needle movement through human tissue, in combination with advanced data processing and deep learning techniques for precise localization. To validate this concept, we designed a specialized phantom using animal tissues submerged in gelatine to collect the vibroacoustic data. This paper summarizes initial experiments, involving data acquisition and preprocessing, conversion into Mel and continuous wavelet transform spectrograms, as well as their use as inputs for two distinct deep learning models: NeedleNet and ResNet-34. The aim of this research was to prove that vibroacoustic signals can be used to identify tissue types during needle insertion and serve as a baseline for further investigations.Clinical relevance: These are the first phantom studies that show the usefullness of vibroacoustic signals that are generated during device-tissue interaction as a support tool for localization information.},

	abstract = {The overall complication rate during laparoscopic access is estimated to be as high as 14 \%. Surgeons have to rely heavily on their experience and haptic perception while inserting the Veress needle or a trocar into the peritoneal cavity. Surgical Audio Guidance (SURAG) is a promising alternative to current techniques. It acquires instrument-born vibroacoustic (VA) waves to track the insertion of the instrument and provide real-time feedback to surgeons. This article presents an initial evaluation of the SURAG technology through two sets of experiments to classify Veress needle events using different AI-models. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using AI for classifying Veress needle events and the potential of the SURAG technology to support surgeons during laparoscopic access and minimally invasive needle interventions in general.},

Intraoperative imaging is not always sufficient or conclusive as it comes with artifacts that can come with a certain amount of ambiguity and inaccurate location information. As an alternative to imaging, we want to explore sounds produced by the biopsy needle tip while advancing and interacting with tissue. In this paper, we show that by analyzing vibroacoustic signals acquired at the proximal end of the needle we are able to differentiate the tissue type. In total, 419 audio samples of 5 tissues were acquired and converted to spectrograms used as input to a convolutional neural network. Using this experimental setup we were able to differentiate the tissue types with an F1 score of 71.64\%. Based on these results we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, as well as the importance of further experiments to ensure that vibroacoustic sounds produced by the needle tip can be a new navigation method.},

Existing systems, such as improved Veress needles and optical trocars, offer limited safety benefits but come with elevated costs. In this study, a prototype of a novel technology for guiding needle interventions based on vibroacoustic signals is evaluated in porcine cadavers. The prototype consistently detected successful abdominal cavity entry in 100% of cases during 193 insertions across eight porcine cadavers. The high signal quality allowed for the precise identification of all Veress needle insertion phases, including peritoneum puncture. The findings suggest that this vibroacoustic-based guidance technology could enhance surgeons' situational awareness and provide valuable support during laparoscopic access. Unlike existing solutions, this technology does not require sensing elements in the instrument's tip and remains compatible with medical instruments from various manufacturers.},
