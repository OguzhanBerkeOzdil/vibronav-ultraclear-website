      "description": "A bi‑national OPUS‑LAP project (DFG/NCN, 2023–2025) creating an audio/vibro‑tactile guidance platform for minimally invasive, needle‑based interventions. By listening to high‑frequency vibrations on surgical instruments and processing them with advanced DSP and machine learning, VibroNav delivers real‑time feedback that helps clinicians place needles more accurately and safely.",
      "longDescription": "VibroNav is an innovative research project that combines advanced signal processing, machine learning, and medical imaging to create a revolutionary guidance system for minimally invasive surgical procedures. The system captures high-frequency vibroacoustic signals from surgical instruments in real-time, processes them using sophisticated algorithms, and provides immediate tactile and auditory feedback to surgeons. This approach enables more precise needle placement, reduces procedural complications, and improves patient outcomes. The project involves close collaboration with clinical partners and integrates cutting-edge acoustic sensing technology with intuitive user interfaces designed specifically for surgical environments.",

This dual-modality system enables real‑time anatomical and functional imaging for procedures like sentinel lymph node biopsy, providing surgeons with unprecedented intra‑operative guidance and improving patient outcomes through more precise, less invasive interventions.",
      "longDescription": "UltraClear represents a paradigm shift in intraoperative imaging technology, seamlessly integrating two complementary imaging modalities into a single, ergonomic handheld device. By combining high-resolution ultrasound imaging with sensitive gamma radiation detection, UltraClear provides surgeons with real-time, multi-modal visualization capabilities that were previously impossible. The system is specifically designed for sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures, where precise localization is critical for patient outcomes. Advanced image fusion algorithms ensure that anatomical and functional information is presented in an intuitive, clinically relevant format, while the compact design maintains the flexibility and ease of use essential for surgical applications.",
