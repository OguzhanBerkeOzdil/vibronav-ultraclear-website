Most imaging systems come with some limitations and produce artifacts in combination with the devices that hinder accurate needle localization, particularly with respect to visualizing the tip of the needle. We propose to use vibroacoustic signals generated during needle movement through human tissue, in combination with advanced data processing and deep learning techniques for precise localization. To validate this concept, we designed a specialized phantom using animal tissues submerged in gelatine to collect the vibroacoustic data. This paper summarizes initial experiments, involving data acquisition and preprocessing, conversion into Mel and continuous wavelet transform spectrograms, as well as their use as inputs for two distinct deep learning models: NeedleNet and ResNet-34. The aim of this research was to prove that vibroacoustic signals can be used to identify tissue types during needle insertion and serve as a baseline for further investigations.Clinical relevance: These are the first phantom studies that show the usefullness of vibroacoustic signals that are generated during device-tissue interaction as a support tool for localization information.",

Existing systems, such as improved Veress needles and optical trocars, offer limited safety benefits but come with elevated costs. In this study, a prototype of a novel technology for guiding needle interventions based on vibroacoustic signals is evaluated in porcine cadavers. The prototype consistently detected successful abdominal cavity entry in 100% of cases during 193 insertions across eight porcine cadavers. The high signal quality allowed for the precise identification of all Veress needle insertion phases, including peritoneum puncture. The findings suggest that this vibroacoustic-based guidance technology could enhance surgeons' situational awareness and provide valuable support during laparoscopic access. Unlike existing solutions, this technology does not require sensing elements in the instrument's tip and remains compatible with medical instruments from various manufacturers.",
