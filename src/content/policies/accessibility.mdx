The **HealthTech Innovation Lab** is committed to providing a website that is accessible to everyone. We aim to meet the **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** guidelines and we continuously improve usability.

## What We Do
- Semantic HTML and clear heading order  
- Keyboard-friendly navigation and visible focus states  
- Sufficient colour contrast and readable font sizes  
- Alt text for meaningful images; decorative images are hidden from assistive tech  
- Responsive layouts that work from mobile to desktop without horizontal scrolling
