In March the NEXTMED conference in San Diego (https://www.nextmed.health/photos-2023) was attended. VIBRONAV was presenting the AUDIO SENSING ideas and was participating in a Start-Up competition.

We gained valuable contacts and research interest from the UC San Diego and University Houston. We will attend again in 2024 and have received a special presentation spot from the organizer Dr. Daniel Kraft.
